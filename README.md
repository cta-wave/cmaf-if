Welcome to the CTA WAVE CMAF-IF wiki.

The CMAF specification is maintained and published by MPEG (formally, ISO/IEC JTC1/SC 29/WG 11 â€“ Coding of moving pictures and audio). The MPEG-CMAF specification defines media profiles that are in scope for the mission of MPEG, including e.g. AVC and MPEG-H.

However, MPEG-CMAF does not define all the media profiles needed by the industry; specifically, it does not define profiles for codecs owned and maintained by groups outside MPEG. Also, WG 11 does not create test infrastructure for non-MPEG media profiles. These decisions are of course consistent with MPEG's goals and scope.

The situation is not new; MPEG-DASH relies on the DASH Industry Forum (DASH-IF) for the evolution of DASH to match industry needs.

Meanwhile, much of the technical discussion of CMAF topics that are outside MPEG scope (including definition of media profiles) has been taking place in CTA WAVE task forces. WAVE is also creating the necessary test infrastructure. Accordingly, CTA WAVE created the CMAF Industry Forum (CMAF-IF) group to host and foster even more discussion of CMAF topics for industry's benefit.
